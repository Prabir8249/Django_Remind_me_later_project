# Django_Remind_me_later_project
This is a very basic implementation and doesn’t include any error handling or validation, which we would want to add in a real-world application. But it should give us a good starting point. The reminder view accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing ‘date’, ‘time’, ‘message’, and ‘method’. It creates a new Reminder object with these values and saves it to the database. If the request is successful, it returns a JSON response with a success message. If the request method is not POST, it returns an error message.
This is a basic implementation and does not include features such as authentication, permissions, or detailed error handling. we would likely want to add these in a production application. Also, remember to add the route to this view in your urls.py file.
